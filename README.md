# Stoneholm

Stoneholm is a **Fabric mod** that adds underground villages to the world. These are a inspired by Strongholds and regular Villages which are my favorite structures in Minecraft.

A Forge port is not planned currently but may happen in the future.

# Technical Info

Underground Villages are jigsaw structures that make use of template pools and processors as well as structure files. There isn't a ton of easy to understand information about creating jigsaw structures but [TelepathicGrunt's StructureTutorialMod repo](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/StructureTutorialMod) has been very helpful when developing this mod.
