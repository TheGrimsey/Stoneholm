# Stoneholm

Stoneholm is a **Fabric mod** that adds underground villages to the world. Inspired by Strongholds and Villages (surprise, huh?).

Explore underground villages that have grown into mazes of hallways, stairs, workspaces, abandoned sections, and overgrown areas.

*A Forge port is* ***not*** *planned currently but may happen in the future.*

# Technical Info

Underground Villages are jigsaw structures that make use of template pools and processors as well as structure files. There isn't a ton of easy to understand information about creating jigsaw structures but [TelepathicGrunt's StructureTutorialMod repo](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/StructureTutorialMod) has been very helpful when developing this mod.
